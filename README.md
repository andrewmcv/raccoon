=======

Raccoon is an experimental language, based on luajit and luma (a powerful hygienic macro system),

Basically, it's going to be a bedrock for experimenting with language constructs, expressiveness, dynamism and concurrency without compromising performance.

We will create a set of macros to completely customize the language: akin to how objective-C customizes and extends C.
